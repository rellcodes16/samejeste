        making rounds online: a woman spoke up about how she had sex two weeks after childbirth and how painful this experience was for her. Netizens called out (rightfully so) 
        her husband for being selfish enough to have even started, let alone continued having sex whilst she was in tears.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Unfortunately, she is not the first, nor will she be the last woman who has to deal with sex postpartum. This is a case 
        that arises in so many marriages, and here we have 5 African women speak on their own issue with sex postpartum.

            “I went in thinking it would just be 15 minutes, before I knew it, almost an hour had passed” — Bessem*, 36
        </p>
        <p>
            Bessem believed since this was her first time her husband wanted sex without intending on getting her pregnant, he deserved it. He got what he wanted, but she didn’t. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “[Her husband] is not the type to have sex whenever he likes - we usually do it with the intention of children, but after our third, he thought it was enough and decided we use protection. It was only just 
            3 weeks after I had given birth and I thought since we weren’t planning on having another one, let me just agree.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went in thinking it would just be 15 minutes, before I knew it,  almost an hour had passed. It was very uncomfortable because of how long it was but I didn’t feel any pain. I started feeling pain later at night and I couldn’t sleep, meanwhile he was fast asleep after getting what he wanted.”

            Chisom started it, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop it, yet she had to wait till he finished.

            “We take our marriage very seriously and try to make sure things work out for both of us. Before we got married we already discussed how many children we want and around what time we would have them. 
            Then came our first - this was when we knew we would take a break from [procreative sex]. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That night I was the one who initiated it - it was already about six weeks after I had delivered - at some point, I started asking myself why I asked for this, I wanted it as much as he did but I was the one 
            who ended up regretting it, I just had to keep going cause I felt it’d be wrong since I woke him up to do it”

            “As painful as it was, though, it was how we got our first boy child” —Khosi*, 46

            Not long after they had their third girl, Khosi embarked on another painful mission with her husband that finally led to a bouncing baby boy.

            “All our children are roughly 1-2 years apart, because I did not marry early and we wanted as many children as possible before I could no longer have them — thinking about it now, it’s not something I will recommend for anyone, 
            because it was a very painful experience. I had family around who made it easier, but it was still a lot for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter how many times I went through it and thought I could get used to it, it was always a different kind of pain each time. For our 
            fourth born, I had pains all over my body. As painful as it was, though, it was how we got our first boy child.”

            “I slept off the first time we tried again, and this was after long I had given birth” —Thelma* 26 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thelma’s story is different because she had a C-section, which she took so long recovering from.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Once I was done with the C-section, I thought to myself ‘now the hard part is over’. Little did I know, it only gets worse. The pain wasn't 
            it at all, but I persevered. Just when I thought I was finally ready again, I ended up being too weak for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I slept off the first time we tried again, and this was long after I had given birth. 
            One minute my husband was above me, the next I woke up to him sleeping beside me.”
