        and giving tips on how to tap into their “feminine energy” — be soft, be meek, be docile — are just a few of those tips,

            The insatiable need for women to “tap into” their femininity all ties back to the belief that femininity is natural 
            to women, and as such, they would want to reach their full divine femininity status that is believed to be innate to them. However, it is clearly not natural to women, given
            that it should come naturally rather than be taught, after all, no one teaches us how to sweat; that comes naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
           Femininity, as opposed to being natural, is actually a performance, one you have to constantly perform, and 
           perform “right”, because it’s a very strict, rigid role, which ultimately ends up excluding a lot of women, 
           particularly Black women and women of color, as femininity has deep roots in white supremacy. It’s why Black 
           women are often “masculinized” by society — compared to men, stereotyped as strong, aggressive, and hypersexual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from white supremacy, it is also rooted in pedophilia, cause it is no coincidence that traits considered
            feminine are childlike, while traits considered masculine are adult-like. These roles were created to complement 
            one another in a heterosexual relationship. It’s why, when a woman acts like a capable adult — being independent 
            and autonomous — she is said to be acting like a man.

            These traits were gendered to uphold male dominance, and not just in personal relationships, but in other spheres of 
            life. Jobs that are considered masculine, like engineering, medicine, and law, are viewed as superior to jobs that are 
            considered feminine, like teaching, nursing, and assisting. Women in traditionally masculine clothing are not 
            ridiculed like men in traditionally feminine clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In essence, masculinity is neutral or superior, while femininity is inferior, which practically 
            makes men the default, and women the “other.” Men can simply be, but women must exist alongside a man to matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Femininity can never be neutral because it was created as an opposite to masculinity, and not the other way around. It was made to serve men. Many traits considered feminine have submission in common. As mentioned earlier 
            in a few tips on tapping into femininity — being soft, meek, and docile — all share one thing: being submissive to men

        <p>
            When women are taught that femininity is natural to them, they’re made to act accordingly — and this helps uphold 
            male dominance. Women who act out of line are then punished for not conforming to what is supposedly natural. 
            In the end, the only people who truly benefit from women “tapping into” their feminine energy are men.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than redefining femininity, it needs to be gotten rid of entirely. This doesn’t mean women would cease to show 
            certain traits, but rather that these traits wouldn’t be used to define women by men. Women can simply be, 
            they can act a certain way because that’s who they are, not because they are women and it’s inherent to them as women.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone would be free to be themselves, however they want to be, and this would be better for everyone. Because, 
            truthfully, no one can fully perform gender stereotypes; we’re all human beings. We’re not supposed to be able to — we’re 
            all different from one another. Billions of people can’t all act the same way just because they share the same genitalia.

          <span className="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mr-3">Conclusion:</span>
          No more tapping into “feminine energy”, and more into simply being ourselves. The idea that femininity is something all women must embrace not only upholds male supremacy but also reinforces racial hierarchies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting rid of rigid gendered expectations doesn’t mean people will stop showing traits like gentleness or care; it just means those traits will no longer be tied to their gender or used to limit them. When we s
            top defining ourselves by how well we fit into roles created for someone else’s comfort, we create room for authenticity.
        </p>

            Let’s stop performing. Let’s start living.
