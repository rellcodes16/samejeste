        human right that we're all entitled to.There are many misconceptions surrounding the term "mental health"—one of 
        the most common being that it's a bourgeois privilege. But it's not. Mental health is just as vital as our physical health; if we're not okay mentally, we can't be physically.

          We each have our own unique mental health issues, but across the sex divide—men and women—our struggles often 
          overlap. There's a common assumption that women have it easy and that men have it harder. While men do face their own challenges simply for being men, 
          those struggles should never be undermined—nor should they be used to undermine the mental health issues women face.    
        </p>
        <p>
          More than ever before, women are beginning to speak up about the challenges they face - challenges that, for so 
          long, were endured in silence. The days of quietly bearing pain are gradually coming to an end, as more women are choosing to share their stories, raise their voices, and seek change. 
          This marks the first step toward solving a problem: identifying it in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is knowing what to do about it. Healing, especially when it comes to mental health, is a journey 
          that requires knowledge, support, and intentional action.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Be your own priority</h3>
        <p>
          You have to put yourself first. Start by setting clear boundaries. It’s okay to say no without offering any explanations. 
          This doesn’t make you a bad person and anyone who truly cares about you will understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take some time off for yourself. Give yourself the much-needed rest you’ve been postponing. You 
          don’t need to perform physical, domestic, or emotional labour for anyone, especially when you’re running on empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, prioritizing yourself doesn’t mean disregarding others. But in moments where you 
          genuinely don’t feel up to something, you should feel completely comfortable saying no, without guilt or pressure.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Be a girl’s girl </h3>
        <p>
          You don’t need to see other women as your competition - they are your sisters. Build community with them. 
          Form close, meaningful relationships with other women. Support them, so that women can, in turn, support you. 
          But don’t do it solely for what you hope to receive; do it out of genuine care and appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, it’s okay not to offer space to every woman you meet. Some may pose a risk to your well-being, and 
          protecting yourself is valid. Still, always remember this: you share more in common with any woman than you ever will with a man. 
          That’s why it’s important to value and nurture the female relationships you have in your life.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Be free from gendered expectations</h3>
        <p>
          You need to let go of the idea of being a “good woman.” That label was never meant for good, it was designed to 
          control you. You don’t have to perform femininity, conform to beauty standards, 
          or meet the ever-changing expectations society places on women. You are allowed to be yourself, unapologetically.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s okay not to have everything figured out. Life is messy and unpredictable, and perfection is a myth. 
          Stop pressuring yourself to get it all right all the time. It’s perfectly normal to struggle with balancing work, home, and personal needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of beating yourself up, give yourself grace. Find what works for you. You are not responsible for the 
          systems that were never designed with your success or peace in mind. The truth is, society has 
          already set women up to lose in a rigged game. But choosing to live on your own terms? That’s where your power lies.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Be the one to end the cycle</h3>
        <p>
          You don’t have to pass down your trauma to other women. If you believe you “turned out fine” despite everything you've endured - and 
          still want other women to go through the same pain - then the truth is, you didn’t turn out as fine as you think.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s time to break the cycle. Generational trauma has plagued women for far too long, passed down like an inheritance no one asked for. But it doesn’t have to continue with you. 
          We have the power to start something new - a cycle of healing, support, and women uplifting one another.

          Women everywhere deserve better mental health support, one that is compassionate, accessible, and free of judgment. If you're struggling with your mental health, 
          remember this: you are not alone. There are people who care, resources that can help, and healing that is possible.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          There is no shame in seeking therapy or asking for support. The shame you've been taught to carry isn’t yours to
          hold. It’s time to unlearn it, to prioritize your well-being, and to choose yourself
        </p>
        <p>
          You are worthy of care, softness, and peace. Always.
