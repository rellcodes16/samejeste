           There’s a lot of talk about female friendships. How female friendships are this and female friendships are that. It’s time we hear from female friends themselves;

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Tell me about your friendship </h1>

          <span className="font-bold">Rese: </span>One thing about Anita that stood out was how genuine she was, before her I had met a lot of performative people, 
          but she was so authentic. I loved that I could be myself around her. We have a lot in common, and of course we have had misunderstandings but we are always willing to talk things out and make it work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Anita: </span> Rese is an amazing person. She is one of the smartest girls I know, not even girls—one of the smartest 
          people I know. She is very considerate of not just me, but others as well. Before she says anything, offline or online, she takes her time to think of how that person would react. 
          She helps build my faith, and it’s nice to have someone like her to talk to about it, because she just gets it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">You said, you both are willing to make things work when there’s a misunderstanding, who typically reaches out first? </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Rese:</span> I think we equally put in effort, but sometimes she brings up stuff more. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Sorry, what kind of stuff?</h1>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Rese:</span> Like, sometimes if we have a misunderstanding, and personally, I feel like I am not being heard – I just recoil and go back into my shell, rather than talk about it. Especially if I have spoken about it repeatedly and I am not being understood. But for Anita, after some time she brings it up again to hash things out. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Anita, you mentioned she helps you build your faith, care to elaborate? </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Anita:</span> Last year, I had been wanting a Bible verse jar for the longest time — it was even on my birthday wishlist, but I was like “who will even get this for me?”, then she did. Most people got an already-made Bible verse jar, but Rese took her time to write mine, which had about twenty or more verses. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Rese, you got her a Bible verse jar?  </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Rese: </span> Oh yes I did that for her birthday. I knew she really wanted it, and I did not have money then to even buy one for her, so I thought about making one myself. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">What did this jar mean to you? </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Anita:</span> It showed that Rese cared about me. I related to the scriptures she wrote a lot, especially during exam period – I would go open the jar – or whenever I was feeling down. I even pasted some of the verses on my wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Rese: </span> I like to think I am a very thoughtful person, so I don’t just give out gifts like that, I actually think about what I am giving out. I don’t do things half-heartedly — I go all in, which is what I did with the Bible verse jar. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-xl">Why do you think your friendship turned out differently from the stereotypical female friendship? </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6 text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Anita:</span>I feel it’s a friendship sent from God. We have grown a lot together and in terms of communication, we try our best to communicate – that’s literally the best quality in our friendship, no matter how painful the truth is, we tell each other. If you really care about someone it’d be your goal to make them behave better honestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-bold">Rese: </span> Firstly, I can’t blame people for viewing female friendships that way. Society tends to pit women against each other. I was able to train myself to know that she is not better than me and I am not better than her, we are both different in our own beautiful way. Also I believe our friendship was engineered by God, all we just have is love and we just want each other to grow and be happy. She is happy when I am happy and I am happy when she is happy.
