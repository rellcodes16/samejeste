From that moment, her entire look is picked apart: How big are her breasts? How wide are her hips? How curvy is her body? Once scrutinized, her worth is then 
        assessed based on how much she “passes”.  The less desirable she is to men, the less worthy she is of being.

          There is nothing inherently better about being desirable; society invented that. Some call this “pretty privilege”, but is it really a privilege if it comes at the expense of one’s personhood? When 
          society only respects women based on how they look, then they don’t respect women – they respect their looks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessing worth based on looks alone is not only placed on women, but the burden is meant to be carried by them alone. There’s this phenomenon called “physiognomy”, where a person’s character is judged by how good they look. It explains why it’s hardly believed that a conventionally attractive man could be capable of committing 
          sexual crimes against women, compared to one who is not. Women are still ultimately bearing the brunt.

          Progressives have decided to take the present situation and redefine what it means to be “beautiful”, but this doesn’t really address the root problem of why our worth is placed on attractiveness. Saying “stretch marks can be sexy too” or other alternative versions of trying to sexify things 
          once considered undesirable doesn’t change the fact that people are still treated differently based on looks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, the next time you or anyone you know is called “ugly”, fight the need to disprove it. There’s nothing wrong with not fitting society’s definition of beauty. If a certain group of people thinks something is ugly, that is their problem to face. Women’s bodies weren’t 
          created to be desirable – breasts are to, not necessarily must, feed; thighs to give birth; and ass to shit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember: your worth is in who you are as a person and how you treat those around you, not in how many men you manage to attract. At the end of the day, there isn’t really any such thing as 
          “ugly” – that is just a Western-imposed beauty standard. Everyone is uniquely attractive to different people.

          <span className="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mr-3">Conclusion:</span>
          The conversation about beauty and desirability should shift from redefining what is considered attractive to
          dismantling the very idea that a woman’s look even matters in the first place. Liberation will only happen when women are valued for their humanity, not their appearance.
